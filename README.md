# proj readme reqs
Your program code should include a README file which details exactly how to start up your
game and provides any information necessary on how to play the game (this information is essential
for the tutors who will test your game).
#

# Suggested stuff should have:
    name of the projects and all sub-modules and libraries (sometimes they are named different and very confusing to new users)
    descriptions of all the project, and all sub-modules and libraries
    5-line code snippet on how its used (if it's a library)
    copyright and licensing information (or "Read LICENSE")
    instruction to grab the documentation
    instructions to install, configure, and to run the programs
    instruction to grab the latest code and detailed instructions to build it (or quick overview and "Read INSTALL")
    list of authors or "Read AUTHORS"
    instructions to submit bugs, feature requests, submit patches, join mailing list, get announcements, or join the user or dev community in other forms
    other contact info (email address, website, company name, address, etc)
    a brief history if it's a replacement or a fork of something else
    legal notices (crypto stuff)
